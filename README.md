# Stock-Price-Prediction

This was my first ever machine learning project for an AI module in University. I learned how to build a Recurrent Neural Network and Random Forest model which gave me great hands on experience which independently with conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building models. Overall I was satified with the outcome of this project as I learned so much from tackling challenges and making mistakes in both the EDA and model building.

## Project Outline

This project aim is to predicting Stock Prices using machine learning techniques. To achieve this, two models are using to predict stock closing prices using time series data on stock price. Models used in this project includes a LSTM RNN model and a Random Forest model with both their performance being compared. The dataset used in this project is 'World Stock Prices' from Kaggle
